## Introduction

In the age of big data and artificial intelligence, **knowledge graphs** have become indispensable for representing structured information about entities and their interrelationships. They play a crucial role in applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and natural language processing tasks. However, the immense size and complexity of knowledge graphs present significant challenges for efficiently querying and extracting relevant information.

This document introduces an approach to summarizing large knowledge graphs by extracting the most relevant subgraphs in response to user queries. By formulating this problem as a **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)** model, we aim to maximize the relevance of the extracted subgraph while adhering to resource constraints. This method enhances the performance of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems and other AI applications that rely on knowledge graphs.

### LLM and MIP: Enhancing Large Language Models

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**, such as GPT-4, excel at generating human-like text and understanding complex questions. Their performance can be further optimized by integrating structured information from **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)**. KGs provide LLMs with a rich source of factual knowledge, enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, due to their massive size and dense connectivity, it is inefficient for LLMs to process entire knowledge graphs directly.

#### Steps in the LLM Process

1. **Understanding the User Query**:

   When a user submits a query, LLMs generate responses based on vast amounts of pre-trained knowledge. However, this knowledge may not always be up-to-date or context-specific.

2. **Incorporating Knowledge Graphs**:

   By leveraging a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, LLMs can access more relevant, real-time information from external knowledge bases. This allows LLMs to augment their responses with verified facts.

3. **Summarizing the Knowledge Graph**:

   A raw knowledge graph contains an overwhelming amount of information. Directly feeding the entire graph into an LLM is impractical. Therefore, we summarize the graph by selecting only the most relevant nodes and edges based on the user's query.

**Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)** assists in this summarization by modeling the selection of the most relevant subgraph as an optimization problem. MIP enables us to maximize the relevance of selected nodes and edges while adhering to computational constraints, ensuring that the extracted subgraph is informative yet manageable.

#### How MIP Improves LLM Performance

- **Efficiency**: MIP ensures that only the most pertinent portions of the knowledge graph are processed by the LLM, reducing computational overhead.

- **Effectiveness**: The optimized subgraph allows LLMs to focus on the most critical information related to the query, improving the quality and accuracy of responses.

- **Scalability**: MIP makes it feasible to handle large-scale knowledge graphs that would otherwise be too cumbersome for real-time LLM queries.

The results of the MIP model—the optimized subgraphs—can be directly provided to LLMs as contextual input. This integration not only ensures more precise answers but also empowers the LLM with up-to-date, query-specific knowledge. Subsequently, the summarized information from the subgraph can be utilized in downstream tasks such as text generation, recommendation systems, or advanced reasoning tasks in a structured manner.

## Problem Definition

**Objective**: Given a large knowledge graph $G = (V, E)$ and a user query $Q$, extract a subgraph $G' = (V', E')$ that maximizes the relevance to the query while satisfying certain constraints on size and connectivity.

**Challenges**:

- **Scalability**: Knowledge graphs can contain millions of nodes and edges.
- **Relevance**: Not all parts of the graph are equally relevant to a given query.
- **Constraints**: Limited computational resources necessitate constraints on the size of the extracted subgraph.

**Importance**:

- **Efficiency**: Extracting a relevant subgraph reduces computational overhead.
- **Effectiveness**: Improves the accuracy of AI systems by focusing on pertinent information.
- **Applicability**: Beneficial for RAG systems, question answering, and information retrieval tasks.

## Mathematical Model

We formulate the problem as a **Mixed Integer Programming** model, aiming to select a subset of nodes and edges that maximizes the total relevance while satisfying specific constraints.

### Variables

- **Node Variables**:
  - $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$ for each node $i \in V$
    - $x_i = 1$ if node $i$ is selected.
    - $x_i = 0$ otherwise.

- **Edge Variables**:
  - $y_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}$ for each edge $(i, j) \in E$
    - $y_{ij} = 1$ if edge $(i, j)$ is selected.
    - $y_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.

### Objective Function

Maximize the total relevance of selected nodes and edges:

$$\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{i \in V} R_i x_i + \sum_{(i, j) \in E} R_{ij} y_{ij}$$

- $R_i$: Relevance score of node $i$.
- $R_{ij}$: Relevance score of edge $(i, j)$.

### Constraints

1. **Edge Inclusion Constraints**:

   An edge can be selected only if both its endpoints are selected:

   $$y_{ij} \leq x_i, \quad \forall (i, j) \in E$$
   $$y_{ij} \leq x_j, \quad \forall (i, j) \in E$$

2. **Connectivity Constraints**:

   A node can be selected only if at least one of its incident edges is selected:

   $$x_i \leq \sum_{j \in N(i)} y_{ij}, \quad \forall i \in V$$

   - $N(i)$: Set of neighbors of node $i$.

3. **Resource Constraints**:

   - **Edge Budget**: Limit the total number of selected edges to $L_{\text{max}}$:

     $$\sum_{(i, j) \in E} y_{ij} \leq L_{\text{max}}$$

   - **Total Budget**: Limit the total number of selected nodes and edges to $C_{\text{max}}$:

     $$\sum_{i \in V} x_i + \sum_{(i, j) \in E} y_{ij} \leq C_{\text{max}}$$

### Summary of the Model

- **Objective**: Maximize relevance.
- **Variables**: Binary variables for node and edge selection.
- **Constraints**: Ensure logical consistency and resource limitations.

## Implementation Details

### Knowledge Graph Construction

We use the **Karate Club graph**, a well-known social network graph representing friendships among individuals.

- **Nodes**: Represent people with assigned attributes:
  - **Label**: "Person X"
  - **Age**: Random integer between 18 and 65.
  - **Occupation**: Randomly selected from a predefined list.
  - **Interests**: Randomly selected interests from a predefined list.

- **Edges**: Represent relationships with attributes:
  - **Predicate**: "friend"
  - **Weight**: Random float between 0.5 and 1.0.
  - **Relationship Type**: Randomly selected from a list (e.g., "colleague", "neighbor").

### Relevance Computation

The relevance of nodes and edges is computed based on the user query.

- **User Query**: "Find engineers interested in sports and technology who are friends of Person 0"

- **Node Relevance ($R_i$)**:

  For each node $i$, compute:

  $$R_i = \frac{\text{Number of matching attributes}}{\text{Total number of query tokens}}$$

  - Matching attributes include labels, occupation, and interests.

- **Edge Relevance ($R_{ij}$)**:

  For each edge $(i, j)$, compute:

  $$R_{ij} = \frac{R_i + R_j + \text{Edge Predicate Relevance}}{3}$$

  - Edge Predicate Relevance is based on the edge's predicate and relationship type.

### Mixed Integer Programming Model

- **Solver**: We use the **CBC (Coin-or branch and cut)** solver from the `ortools` library.

- **Variables**: Defined for nodes and edges as per the mathematical model.

- **Objective Function**: Set up to maximize total relevance.

- **Constraints**: Implemented according to the mathematical model.

### Enhancing the Knowledge Graph

By adding attributes to nodes and edges, we create a richer graph that allows for more sophisticated relevance computations. This enables the model to capture nuanced relationships and produce more meaningful subgraphs in response to complex queries.
